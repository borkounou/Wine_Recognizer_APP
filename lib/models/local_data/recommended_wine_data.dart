          "A funky glint of smoke and yeast precedes rich notions of mirabelle and peach compote. The palate enforces this notion of rich sweet compote even more and adds a welcome lemony vein of freshness to it. There is great balance here between juicy ripe sweetish fruit and tangy uplifting freshness. The finish is off dry and generously fruited.",

          "Winemaker Isabelle Meunier (ex-Evening Land) has carefully selected a handful of sites for her first release of single-vineyard wines under this new label. This is perhaps the most elegant, with exceptional texture, color and overall finesse. Fruits are delicate and detailed, showing watermelon, salmonberry, strawberry and a bit of spice. The 30% new French oak aging adds a gentle kiss of cocoa. Drink now to 2030 and beyond.",
